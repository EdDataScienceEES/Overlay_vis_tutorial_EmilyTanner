# Understanding and Implimenting R Overlay and Multilayer Visualization
## Emily Tanner
## Due: Friday December 03

## In this folder you will find all the necessary materials for my final tutorial assignment of the Data Science in EES course. 

### Repo Organization:

#### Principal documents:
* assignment_instructions.md details the parameters of the assigment and marking criteria
* "overlay_vis_tutorial.rmd" contains the final completed tutorial, for which a corresponding knitted version overlay_vis_tutorial.html" exists
 
#### Folders:
* figures: all relevant figures produced within my script. These can also be found directly in the "overlay_vis_tutorial.rmd" or "overlay_vis_tutorial..html"
* images: this folder contains images used in my overlay_vis_tutorial. rmd document
* resources: this folder contains additional resources that were helpful for myself in the creation of this tutorial. Any references or resources used directly in the .rmd document are mentioned within the document.

### Tutorial Aims:

Key learning points:

1. the layered nature of R visualizations: how we can build upon on a preliminary plot with layers

2. how different packages and functions i.e. `par` & `facet_wrap` can create similar results

3. thinking critically about which option most effectively represents data and communicates your message

Tutorial sections:

 1. how we can visualize data using layered functions of ggplot2
 2. how we can split our plotting device to visualize relationships between variables 
 3. how we can overlay histograms with curve, lines and rug functions to visualize data
 

My tutorial is aimed at beginner users for R but it is hoped that my tutorial is useful for any user through provideing clear, accessible and engaging information.

# Thank you!
